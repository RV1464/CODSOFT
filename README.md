INTERNSHIP TASKS
## 1. TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
The Titanic survival prediction project is a popular introduction to machine learning. It aims to predict passenger survival using historical data like age, sex, and social class. After acquiring and cleaning the data, features like "sex" are converted into numerical formats. Machine learning models are then trained to identify patterns between these features and survival outcomes. Evaluating the model's accuracy on unseen data ensures it can make reliable predictions on new information. This project offers insights into factors affecting survival and serves as a learning ground for data analysis and model building. However, it's crucial to remember that the actual disaster involved numerous complexities beyond the scope of this simplified model.
Gaussian Model has been used.
## 2. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
The Iris flower classification project serves as a springboard for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning classification. Here, the objective is to identify the specific species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) of an Iris flower based solely on its measurable characteristics. This involves collecting data on four key features: sepal and petal length and width. Machine learning algorithms, like Logistic Regression, are then trained to analyze these features and establish patterns that link them to the flower's species. Essentially, the model learns to associate specific petal and sepal dimensions with each unique Iris type. To ensure the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, its performance is assessed using unseen data. This guarantees the model's ability to accurately classify new, unencountered flowers. While the Iris project provides a solid foundation for grasping classification tasks, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, it's important to remember that more complex real-world classification problems might necessitate further refinement and adaptation of the approach.
## 3. CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Credit card fraud detection systems leverage machine learning to combat unauthorized transactions. Imagine a digital guardian constantly analyzing your spending habits. Transaction details like location, amount, and time are fed into the system. Machine learning algorithms then scour this data for anomalies. Factors like unusual purchase locations, sudden spikes in spending, or transactions outside typical spending patterns raise red flags. The system can then alert the cardholder or financial institution for verification, potentially preventing fraudulent activity. While this approach offers a robust defense, fraudsters continuously devise new schemes. Therefore, machine learning models require constant training and adaptation to stay ahead of evolving threats.
